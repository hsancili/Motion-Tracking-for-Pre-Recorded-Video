# Colorful Blob Detection for Dance Video
 
This code identifies motion in a pre-recorded video using blob detection and attempts to identify the circle gesture from the $1 Unistroke library. Video must be a QuickTime .mov file. Some fun adjustments that can be made to this code are altering the colors of the shapes and changing the gesture to be detected.
